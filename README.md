# MERF-simulation
MSc thesis project – model comparison on clustered data
# Mixed Effects and Machine Learning Models on Clustered Data

This repository contains R code developed as part of my MSc thesis in Statistics.

The project focuses on comparing statistical and machine learning models
for clustered data using simulation and PMSE evaluation.

## Models
- Linear Model (LM)
- Linear Mixed Effects Model (LME)
- Regression Tree (RT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Mixed Effects Regression Tree (MERT)

## Data
The original study is based on publicly available health indicators from
31 Sub-Saharan African countries (2001–2018).
Simulated data are used in this repository for reproducibility.

## Notes
This work was conducted under academic supervision.
